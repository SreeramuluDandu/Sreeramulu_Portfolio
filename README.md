# Sreeramulu Dandu - Data Analysis Portfolio 

### About
I'm Sreeramulu! I have a technical background and holding a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in geoscience (Saint Petersburg Mining University), majoring in Seismic Data Processing and Analysis. I had worked for 12 years in geoscience playing roles as Data Processing Engineer, Head of Department and CTO in a technological startup. After one year of transition from geoscience to Data Analysis, I'm Data Analyst in a Fintech company now.
I have recently achieved the 7th place at the open Data Analyst 2021 competition held by Career Factory

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
